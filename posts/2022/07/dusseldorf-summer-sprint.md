I'm happy to announce that we will finally have another PyPy/HPy/other sprint
in Dusseldorf, Germany from September 19-23, 2022.

The sprint will be located at Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf. Many
thanks to Carl Friedrich for organizing this.

We will again follow an open format, i.e., everyone that is interesting in HPy,
PyPy, or some related topic is welcome to join the sprint.

There is no formal registration nor any fee for participation. Just to know who
we should expect to show up, we kindly ask to send an email to <TBD>.

# Goals and topics of the sprint

From the HPy point of view, there is no strict agenda. The main goal of the
sprint is to make progress on HPy in any way you can think of.
This includes but is not limited to:

  - Review, discuss, maybe merge open GitHub PRs.
  - Hacking on HPy: implement new features, fix bugs, etc.
  - Come up with ideas for blog posts or even write blog posts.
  - Migrate packages to HPy or just determine candidates for migration.

# Accomodation

TBD
