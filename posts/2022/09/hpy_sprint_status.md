As we announced in
[this blog post](https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2022/07/dusseldorf-sprint-2022/),
we are currently having our joint PyPy/HPy/GraalPy sprint in Dusseldorf.

Yesterday, we did the HPy sprint report. Most notably, we also had several
CPython core developers in the call.

The sprint report was streamed on
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pypyproject) and the recording is still
available.

<!--TEASER_END-->

One of the main goals in the sprint was to write a PEP to officially propose
HPy as an Python C extension API. We started to do so but before we actually
submit this PEP, we wanted to have some feedback if that makes sense. So,
we invited the Python core developers to our call and quite some of them
followed the invitation.

We therefore gave a short overview of HPy since not everyone might know it yet.
We talked about the goals and non-goals of HPy and basically asked if Python
core developers would be willing to support our project

We had some very good discussions and we also got some valuable feedback.
Our next steps are now to incorporate this feedback and prepare the PEP to
continue discussions there and gather more feedback.

We thank the Python core developers for participating in the call and for the
offered support.
